The package allows you to download administrative boundary shapes and street networks (=geometries) from OpenStreetMap from which you can construct, project, visualise, and analyse complex street networks. Because OSMnx is built on top of NetworkX, matplotlib, and geopandas - that you have already used - the network analysis and spatial queries generation with R-tree is rich and fast.
